# Intro:
This package provide a simple Franka arm and Robotiq Gripper simulator written in Mujoco.
It includes a state-based and a vision-based Franka lift cube task environment.

# Installation:
- From `hil-serl` folder, cd into `franka_sim`.
- In your `hil-serl` conda environment, run `pip install -e .` to install this package.
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install sim dependencies.

# Explore the Environments
- Run `python franka_sim/test/test_gym_env_human.py` to launch a display window and visualize the task.
- Run `python franka_sim/test/test_gym_env_joystick.py --controller_type=<controller_type>` to launch a display window and use joystick to control the arm. `controller_type` can be `ps5` or `xbox`.

# Run Experiments
- Run `python examples/experiments/record_success_fail_sim.py --exp_name pick_cube_sim --successes_needed 2000` to record success and failure trajectories which is used for training the reward model, you can define the number of successes needed. Controller type can be set in `examples/experiments/pick_cube_sim/config.py`.
- Run `python examples/experiments/record_demos_sim.py --exp_name pick_cube_sim --successes_needed 30` to record demonstrations for training the policy, you can define the number of successes needed. Controller type can be set in `examples/experiments/pick_cube_sim/config.py`.
- To train a rlpd agent to solve the pick cube task:
    - `cd examples/experiments/pick_cube_sim` 
    - run `bash run_actor.sh`
    - run `bash run_learner.sh`

# Credits:
- This simulation is initially built by [Kevin Zakka](https://kzakka.com/).
- Under Kevin's permission, we adopted a Gymnasium environment based on it.

# Notes:
- Error due to `egl` when running on a CPU machine:
```bash
export MUJOCO_GL=egl
conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng
```
